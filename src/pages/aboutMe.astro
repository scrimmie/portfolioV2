            I am a driven, passionate technologist who combines logic and
            discipline with interpersonal skills that power new thinking.
            <br />
            <br /> As far back as I can remember, I&apos;ve had a fascination with
            how things work. My natural curiosity has helped me learn and discover.
            <br />
            <br /> As a team player, I thrive on collaboration, and have an innate
            interest in the world around me â€” especially when technology can impact
            the lives of others.
