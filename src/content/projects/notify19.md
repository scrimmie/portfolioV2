## Project Description:

Notify-19 was a college class project with a turnaround time of two weeks. The task was to design and construct a fully functioning application that could be utilized to track and notify users of possible COVID-19 exposure.

This project utilizes NextJS for both the frontend and backend services and a PostgresSQL database for user information storage. The project utilizes Tailwind CSS to style the frontend as well as optimize it for mobile platforms.
