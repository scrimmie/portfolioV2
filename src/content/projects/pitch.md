## Project Description:

Pitch is a community and data driven platform for sharing and enhancing music listening events.

The Pitch platform offers a myriad of functionalities, mainly:

- Music Listening Event Orchestration
- Music Recommendation and Voting System
- DJ Rating System
- Live User Metrics

Pitch is designed utilizing Spotify to provide its users the most enjoyable group listening experience while feeding live data and metrics to the DJ of the event.

â€‹Pitch offers its users a unique experience where everyone at an event is the DJ. Based on a users participation they receive a "DJ Rating" encouraging them to discover new music.
