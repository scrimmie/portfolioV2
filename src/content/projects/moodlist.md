## Project Description

Moodlist offers the user a dashboard where they can view their top six Spotify artists, previously created playlists, as well as generate a new playlist. MoodList is built around an algorithm that pays close attention to the users desired mood (happy/sad) as well as a selected genre and their top artists to produce a playlist that best suits them. These playlists can be viewed and directly played in MoodList's intuitive user interface.

The MoodList project was created for a collegiate level course focused around web app development. The app is built around a React.js frontend and a Node.js backend.

The goal of MoodList is to offer Spotify users more functionality and input on procedurally generated playlists giving them a playlist for every situation throughout the day that they would enjoy.
