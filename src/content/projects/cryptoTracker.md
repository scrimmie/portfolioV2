## Project Description

CryptoTracker is a project designed to give a user a desktop view of their current portfolio value as well as a breakdown of their portfolios makeup including the individual coins prices, and 24-hour percentage change.

This project was a weekend project that aimed to create a constant visual for the user to update them on their status in a very volatile market.
